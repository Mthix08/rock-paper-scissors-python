# rock-paper-scissors-python

This is a simple "console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game" written in Python. 
It allows the player to compete against the computer in a classic game of luck and strategy.

# How It Works

- The player chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The computer randomly picks one of the three options.
- The game compares both choices and declares a winner.

 # What I Learned

- How to use "if" / "elif"  and "else"  statements
- Handling user input
- Using "Random" to generate unpredictable computer choices
- Writing clean and understandable logic

# Features

- Player vs Computer mode
- Input validation (basic)
- Clear output of winner/loser/tie

# Future Improvements

- Add score tracking (best of 3 or 5)
- Improve error handling for invalid input
- Allow player to play multiple rounds in a loop
- Add GUI (Windows Forms or WPF) version later
